An AI-powered medical diagnostic screening tool that detects Sleep Apnea patterns in ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals. Using advanced feature extraction and a Random Forest classifier, this system provides a non-invasive, quick, and reliable preliminary assessment of sleep apnea severity.

## 🏥 Project Overview

Sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder where breathing repeatedly stops and starts. Traditional diagnosis (Polysomnography) is expensive and intrusive. This project leverages the correlation between heart rate variability (captured via ECG) and respiratory effort to provide a cost-effective screening solution.

### Key Features
- **ECG-Based Detection**: Analyze standard ECG signals for apnea patterns.
- **Machine Learning Analysis**: High-performance Random Forest model with **85.2% accuracy**.
- **Severity Classification**: Automatically categorizes results into Normal, Mild, Moderate, or Severe.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Modern, glassmorphic UI built with Streamlit.
- **Smart Chatbot**: Integrated medical assistant for sleep apnea queries.
- **Signal Visualization**: Real-time plotting of ECG windows and detection events.
